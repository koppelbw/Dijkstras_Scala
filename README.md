# Dijkstras_Scala
Learning the Scala language by implementing Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.

This program was created using a Scala Eclipse IDE.
The program takes in 3 inputs:
  startingLocation: String
  endingLocation: String
  edges: List[Map[String, Any]]
  
Please read the 'ProjectPlan.pdf' located in the repository for more information about how I approached this project.
